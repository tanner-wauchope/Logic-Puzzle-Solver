====================

This command line program reads in facts about a group of people who are assumed to have unique names, jobs, and houses. With incomplete information, the program tries to infer the attributes of every entity from the facts provided. It detects if attributes are under-constrained or over-constrained. I wrote this without a skeleton in Java.
